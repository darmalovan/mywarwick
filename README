Setup
--------

You will need a recent JDK, 8 ideally. You will need `node` (with `npm`) installed in order to build the static assets.

To get Node dependencies run `npm install`.

Get a global `gulp` command with `npm install -g gulp-cli` in case you don't already have it.

Building and running
--------------------

To build assets, run `gulp assets`.
To continually build assets when they change, run `gulp wizard`.

To start the app, run `./activator "run 8080"`. You can choose a different port but using 8080 might make it simpler
to re-use your Apache/Nginx proxy config that you have working for Tomcat.

You probably also need to run the `content-providers` app to generate content for your tiles.
