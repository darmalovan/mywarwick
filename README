My Warwick
=====

Setup
--------

You will need a recent JDK, 8 ideally. You will need `node` (with `npm`) installed in order to build the static assets.

To get Node dependencies run `npm install`.

Get a global `gulp` command with `npm install -g gulp-cli` in case you don't already have it.

Building and running
--------------------

To build assets, run `gulp assets`.
To continually build assets when they change, run `gulp wizard`.

To start the app, run `./activator "run 8080"`. You can choose a different port but using 8080 might make it simpler
to re-use your Apache/Nginx proxy config that you have working for Tomcat.

You probably also need to run the `content-providers` app to generate content for your tiles.

Functional tests
----------------

Still in progress.

You need to populate `conf/functional-test.conf` based on the example file.

Run them with the `fun:test` task.

Will run using a default browser set (Firefox), but you can override this by
passing `TEST_BROWSERS=chrome,firefox` environment variable when running.

Most browsers typically don't support the standard WebDriver API directly, and
need a driver program as glue between Selenium and the browser.
Chrome requires `chromedriver` on the `PATH`, and Firefox requires `geckodriver`.
If either of them stop working, it's generally because these are missing or because
the version of the browser is not compatible with the version of the driver or
the version of Selenium, so try upgrading everything to the latest.

Main issues:

 * There is only one test
 * Browser windows don't close afterwards
